# HabboAPI
This PHP wrapper library is used to collect data from the _undcoumented_ Habbo API.  
The project requires PHP 5.3 and uses the Composer autoloader and PSR-4 standard.

See the `example.php` file on how you could use this library.

## How to use it
1. Add [the Composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/gerbenjacobs/habbo-api) to your package.json file: `"gerbenjacobs/habbo-api": "v2.*"`
2. On the page you want to use it add `include 'vendor/autoload.php'`
3. Create a HabboParser and construct it with the Habbo domain extension "com", "com.br", "de" etc.
4. Create a HabboAPI instance and inject the HabboParser in the constructor

## Usage
```php
    <?php
    // Include the Composer autoloader
    include 'vendor/autoload.php';
    
    // Shortcut for the FQN
    use HabboAPI\HabboAPI;
    use HabboAPI\HabboParser;
    
    // Create new Parser and API instance
    $habboParser = new HabboParser('com');
    $habboApi = new HabboAPI($habboParser);
    
    // Find the user 'koeientemmer' and get their ID
    $koeientemmer = $habboApi->getHabbo('koeientemmer')->getId();
    
    // Collect all the profile info
    $profile = $habboApi->getProfile($koeientemmer);
```
